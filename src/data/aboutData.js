    'Christian Reals is principally an online dating website for Christian singles. Christian Reals was the vision of Ebere Alo Nneji, driven by the passion to see Christians form God-centred relationships and to see Christian marriages form and blossom.',
    'Christian Reals is built to provide a safe place for genuine Christian singles to meet other like-minded Christian singles for real meaningful relationships, potentially leading to marriage.',
    'From the days of Adam and Eve to present day, life has changed a lot; and so has the way we meet people, including that special someone.',
    'As the internet has increasingly become the go-to-place for almost all of life’s needs including finding love, it is little wonder that it is also awash with all kinds of scams and fake websites.',
    'Even within churches and Christian communities, it has become increasingly difficult to meet people who are genuine Christians and serious about their faith.',
    'This is even more challenging on online platforms where people can hide their true identities while presenting a false identity to their online audience.',
    'Day by day, many fall victim to scams and frauds perpetrated through online dating platforms. At Christian Reals, safety is at the heart of everything we do. We take fake profiles and scammers seriously. We do not buy profiles from other websites. All profiles on our website are screened and monitored by us.',
    'Whilst we are not a match-making or marriage-fixing agency, we hope we have provided a platform that will help you on your journey to finding that special someone and to ultimately find lasting love and happiness in marriage.',
